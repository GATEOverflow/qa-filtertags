Enables admins to hide questions belonging to sertain tag(s) globally from the site. This is usual to hide ceratin questions for sometime or for ever. Questions belonging to the selected tags (to be done on admin form) won't show up on question pages, recent activity or on individual question pages.  

Move the selects.php file to qa-include/db/selects.php replacing the one there. This is tested for Q2A 1.8, if you are using previous versions try by taking a backup first.

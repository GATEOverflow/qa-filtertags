# Top Search
Question2answer Top Search
Adds a widget which lists the top searched content

Has an admin option to choose betwween normal search results and tag search results.
Tag Search is given by this plugin: http://www.question2answer.org/qa/52496/tag-search-plugin-free

Plugin requires Event Logger to be turned on. 

Styling of the widget can be done via the admin interface. 

This is a beta code, using it at your own risk on a production environment. 

Plugin would not work if you are using google custom search instead of Q2A search.
